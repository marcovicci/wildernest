<p><b>WilderNest is about the pets.</b><br>
This is a game about adopting, improving, and customizing pets, first and foremost.<br>
Whatever other features the site has, they have to be in service of this goal.<br></p>

<p>Everyone has different ideas of what makes a virtual pet fun to care for.<br>
To keep things tight, WilderNest can't possibly provide for all of them - at least, not now.<br>
WilderNest pet care is broken into two different categories (so far).<br><br>
<i>Improvement:</i> when pets can be physically trained or maybe made smarter,and compete in some way with these stats!<br><br>
<i>Customization:</i> that's changing the look of pets, adding backdrops and cosmetic items, or even accessorizing them with mini pets.</p>

<p>There's some core features we're hoping to have before we launch...<br>
<ul>
<li>Pets - of course. Expect a few different species, basic color-changers, and at least one special color to start with.</li>
<li>Social features - friends, boards, and private messages.</li>
<li>Games - not just to earn currency, but as monthly or weekly competitions (with trophies to show off).</li>
<li>Cosmetic equipables - like layerable background and foreground items to make your pets unique.</li>
<li>Training and contests - compete against AI components or other players in virtual pet shows.</li>
<li>Hidden features - avatars and other unlockables that you get the old fashioned way, by solving a puzzle on-site.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>...and just so you know what to expect, there's some other features we aren't planning.<br>
<ul>
<li>Clothes for pets - for the sake of keeping poses dynamic, don't expect fitted clothing.</li>
<li>Breeding - in order to avoid treating pets as disposable, the focus will be on improving and changing your original pets.</li>
<li>Human avatars - that art talent is be better utilized on pet-oriented art.</li>
</ul>
