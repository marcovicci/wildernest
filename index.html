  # welcome to wildernest
  *where lucky starlight currently chucks her second life stuff*

  **Q: What's Second Life?**

  A: You're in for a wild ride. [Second Life](http://secondlife.com/) is a 3D virtual world with its own niche communities, user-run economy, events, coding language, and much more. It's been running since 2003 (that's 18 years ago at the time I write this). Residents of Second Life can own and decorate virtual property, create and sell clothing, body parts and other 3D modeled/textured goodness, play games, go to virtual live music venues, watch film premiers, learn other languages, shop endlessly, fall in love, etc. It has limitless potential, but seems to mostly be sex and furries.

  **Q: I'm still listening.**

  A: Thanks! Let's move on.

  ## so what's all this then?

  In Second Life I go by the name [Lucky Starlight](https://my.secondlife.com/lucky.starlight) and I run a shop called [LSLS](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/stores/242593) where I sell a lot of random stuff. I thought I should have a more collected virtual storefront for that, and also have a place to put scripting information, guides to playing the game, directories of cheap cool stuff I've found, etc.

  ## how can i contact you?

  You can either send me a message in-world at **Lucky Starlight** or an email at **lucky**@**wilderne.st** - thanks!

  ## were you here for something else?

  I used to use this website solely to host information about a Discord bot I was tinkering with.

  You can still view that information over at the [pets page](http://wilderne.st/pets.html) but watch out, that stuff hasn't been updated in ages.

  Someday the Wildernest bot et all will come back, I'm just super busy!
