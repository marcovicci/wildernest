  # welcome to wildernest
  *where lucky starlight currently chucks her second life stuff*
  
  This is a quick-start guide to get used to Second Life and get your first avatar set up.

  ## BEFORE WE BEGIN

  First things first, you're going to need to go to the [Second Life website](https://secondlife.com/) and sign up.

  Second Life usernames have a first and last name. However, on your first time signing up in the modern era, your surname will always be Resident. Anyone with a different surname either signed up before the shift to "username-style" names, or paid Linden Labs some real money to change their name. You might hear this full name referred to as a **Legacy Name** as well.

  After you finish signing up, you will be asked to download the Second Life client. **We're NOT going to do this, though.** The clients used to access Second Life are called "viewers". There are a great many viewers, and you are encouraged to experiment with them, but I will be suggesting you download and start with what I believe is the most beginner-friendly viewer. This viewer is called **Firestorm** and is what you'll be using to access the game.

  Head over to the [Firestorm website](https://www.firestormviewer.org/os/) and download the installer for your operating system. Run the installer and agree to the terms.

  I recommend saying YES when you're asked if you want to register Firestorm as a handler for virtual world links - this will allow you to more easily use URLs on the web that are meant to send you somewhere in-game!

  ![](./starterguide2.png)

  When you close the installer, you'll be asked if you want to start Firestorm now. Let's say yes.

  ![](./starterguide3.png)

  I've entered my username and password so I'm ready to log in! Don't worry about any of the other options here yet - some of them might be useful later though.

  On your first login you will be asked to agree to more terms and conditions and you may also be asked to allow the SL Voice protocol to work on your network. Then, just like that, you're in!

  ![](./starterguide4.png)

  The very first thing I'm going to ask you to do is change some settings. You can change these back if you hate them, but for now they might make things a little easier. Let's open the preferences window by hitting **CTRL-P** or finding it under **AVATAR** in the top left of the screen.

  ![](./starterguide5.png)

  Here, I've changed my settings to allow me to access all types of content. You have to be an adult to use Second Life, and most areas rated "Adult" are not actually (just) for sex, so this will let you go anywhere.

  ![](./starterguide6.png)

  I recommend limiting your framerate to something sensible even if you have a pretty beefy computer. This is a good time to mess with your graphics settings as well and make sure everything is running smoothly. For the most part, you won't miss out by having your graphics lower. Do note that the **Advanced Lighting Model** checkbox is required to see when things are shiny, so not everything will look right without it.

  ![](./starterguide7.png)

  I prefer being able to move my camera through objects, and to move it in any direction I like. Your mileage may vary.

  ![](./starterguide8.png)

  We're almost done! Check **Pressing letter keys effects movement** here so that when you hit WASD, you walk, rather than typing into the bar at the bottom of the screen.

  ![](./starterguide9.png)

  Finally, turn off the pie menu option. The pie menu appears when you right click something - it's much simpler to have a list of options rather than a radial menu with multiple layers.

  One of the most important skills you'll need to master in Second Life is control of your camera. By default, it is centered behind you in the first-person style. You'll frequently want to look at something else, and just zooming out with the mouse wheel isn't going to cut it!

  By holding down ALT, you will see your cursor change to a magnifying glass with a + on it. Still holding ALT, click on your head and drag the mouse. You'll quickly discover that alt-clicking has set a new pivot point for your camera, and dragging allows you to rotate around that point. If you want to pivot up and down, you can keep holding ALT and dragging, but also hold CTRL! Mastering pivoting your camera will help you navigate the world and people-watch. Moving (or pressing ESC) will reset your camera, so don't worry if you get lost. Using this method, you can get a good view of yourself...

  ![](./starterguide10.png)

  ...hmm, that's not very good. Now that you know how to move with WASD and cam around, go ahead and follow the arrows on the ground. Firestorm automatically starts you in an orientation area, and will do its best to teach you the basic controls. (Because we've changed away from that weird radial pie menu, you'll want to follow the secondary set of instructions on some of the signs, but it tells you how to do it both ways.) This tutorial area even gives you a bunch of free items, which will be very useful shortly - next we're going to get onto the real meat of second life, wearing and editing avatars!

  A lot of the time, editing your avatar will require dropping things on the ground, also known as "rezzing" them. Maybe this is a boxed item you want to unpack, maybe it's just something that's easier to edit when it isn't attached to your body. At any rate, you aren't allowed to rez items in every area of Second Life. To rez and edit items, you'll have to go to a **sandbox**, sort of a free-for-all modding area. Luckily, Firestorm provides access to one on the teleport board at the end of its tutorial. You can also visit it by clicking this link or copying and pasting it into the bar at the top of the Firestorm window: http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Firestorm%20Sandbox/123/136/2703

  ![](./starterguide11.png)

  It's time to make Wildyr look a little prettier!

  For your convenience, I have a small list of free/cheap starter avatars over at the [starters page](http://wilderne.st/starters.html) on this website. For now, I'm going to begin by getting the free [Ruth avatar](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/Ruth2-v4-Mesh-Avatar/20220006) off the marketplace. After you click "Buy Now", scroll to the bottom of the page (free items like to show you an extra page of advertisements) to find the button to place your order and then, finally, the last "Buy Now" button to confirm your "payment" of zero lindens.

  ![](./starterguide12.png)

  You'll know that you did everything right if you're notified back in Firestorm of your purchase being delivered.

  ![](./starterguide13.png)

  Open up your inventory and you can find marketplace purchases in the "Received Items" section at the very bottom. When you're ready, you can drag the **Ruth2 V4 - Mesh Avatar** object onto the ground in front of you. Many newer boxed items will also support being unpacked by being "added" to your avatar, but we're learning how to do it the old fashioned way here!

  ![](./starterguide14.png)

  ![](./starterguide15.png)

  The Ruth body here uses an automatic unpacker, so I just had to click on it and then ACCEPT the folder it gives me in the top-right.

  ![](./starterguide16.png)

  Other boxes might not unpack automatically, but that's okay - you can also right-click objects and select OPEN, then copy the items to your inventory that way.

  ![](./starterguide17.png)

  Either way, now we have a folder in our inventory with all the parts to our new avatar. You can see a few different types of objects here by their thumbnails - notecards (which will contain text information), system clothing layers (in this case, underwear), a skin (that Starlight Medium object), eyes, hair, body shape, and tons of attachments (those miscellaneous yellow boxes). We're going to hit the ground running - we want to be wearing everything in this folder, and nothing we're currently wearing, so I'm going to right click the name of the folder and select REPLACE CURRENT OUTFIT. We'll end up with a few things doubled up, but that's totally fine; we can take them off afterwards!

  ![](./starterguide18.png)

  After some spammed loading messages, I am now wearing everything in the Ruth folder. It may not be easy to tell immediately, but this body has much more detail than the default one I was wearing before, and it's been 3D modeled in an external program! You can see my hands and feet are kind of messed up - Ruth came with multiple poses of feet and shapes of fingernails, and I'm wearing all of them at once! No problem - let's take those off.

  ![](./starterguide19.png)

  I've decided to only keep the "flat" feet and toenails, since I'm going barefoot for now, so I can simply right click the other feet and toenails states in my inventory, and detach them from myself. The same goes for all but one of the sets of fingernails.

  ![](./starterguide20.png)

  Like many avatars in Second Life, Ruth comes with a "HUD", or a heads-up display. HUDs always attach to your screen (so only you can see it), rather than your avatar (where everyone else can see it). In my inventory, I can see the Ruth v4 HUD is worn on my Top Left, and sure enough, there's a button in that corner of my screen!

  ![](./starterguide21.png)

  Clicking this HUD expands it and gives me options to change things like my fingernail color. On the ALPHA tab, I can select body parts to get "alphaed" - this means they become completely transparent, and it's useful for fitting into clothes that don't conform perfectly to your body shape. The SKIN tab allows me to select between a few skin tones and eye colors, but we don't need to - the default selection, BAKED ON MESH, is much more powerful!

  ![](./starterguide22.png)

  Let's discover the power of baked on mesh...

  ![](./starterguide23.png)

  I'm wearing the default eyes that come with the Ruth body, but I picked up a free pair of eyes from the end of the Firestorm tutorial. When I right click and wear them, the eyes that fit the Ruth avatar "bake on" the texture and display it! This is pretty cool with eyes (especially if you're using an animal or furry avatar, and you still get to use any set of free eyes you want) but it becomes really powerful when you layer skins, tattoos, makeup and clothing on top of any shape of mesh (3d sculpted) body.
